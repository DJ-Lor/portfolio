# 🌺 Personal Portfolio #
 
```
 → version 1.1
```

This project is my second personal portfolio since starting my coding journey. The [first portfolio](https://github.com/DJ-Lor/lorelidejesus_T1A2) was built using only HTML5 and CSS during my first term - and here we are on my last term welcoming my updated version for my work. 

### 🤔 Challenge

There were so many things I wanted to convey, both from a technical and non-technical standpoint, for this project. Overall, I wanted to ensure that my portfolio will communicate a clear message in terms of design, build and communication - that is, to showcase my skills and capabilities as a competent Full Stack Engineer. 

### 💡 Solution

I had initially only planned to use `React CSS` and `CSS`, however, I wanted to take this opportunity to further grow my skillset and started working with `Tailwind CSS`. I heard great things about it and personally, found my work efficiency improving when it comes to styling on the same file where my source code is. I have also looked into utilising `Nextjs` for the first time for this project. Its speed due to its server-side rendering functionality has been considered highly, most especially for static websites.


### 🧰 My Tech Toolbox (Stack, Tools & NPM Packages)

- Next.js 
- Node.js 
- Tailwind CSS
- React-icons
- React-fontawesome
- Heroicons (svg icons by Tailwind)
- Ion-icons
- Google Fonts 

### 💪🏼  Future Improvements

- [ ] Individual page for every `Project` 
- [ ] Accessibility improvements
- [ ] Utilising React-hooks for an interactive portion of the site (possibly a game or fun api)
- [ ] Unit testing integrations
